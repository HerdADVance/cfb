                        <h1 class="team-title">Texas Longhorns</h1>
                        <p>Is Texas Back?&trade; Joe Tessitore certainly jumped the gun after the Longhorns' thrilling overtime defeat of Notre Dame back on Labor Day weekend in 2016, but it appears that Tom Herman has finally turned his team into a legitimate Big XII and national player for the forseeable future.</p>
                        <p>Texas's offense didn't provide fantasy players with an abundance of options in 2018, but it did produce three absolute studs in sophomore QB <strong>Sam Ehlinger</strong> and his top two targets &mdash; juniors <strong>Lil'Jordan Humphrey</strong> and <strong>Collin Johnson</strong>. Humphrey is off to the NFL, but Ehlinger and Johnson return as elite 2019 fantasy targets at their respective positions.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned, there wasn't much to get excited about after those three. Running back was almost a perfect time share between senior <strong>Tre Watson</strong> and true freshman <strong>Keaontay Ingram</strong>, and Ehlinger hogged too many of the rushing TD's for either to provide consistent production. The good news is that Ingram was the much more talented back and could very well be a true bellcow as a sophomore in 2019.</p>
                        <p>Speedster junior WR <strong>Devin Duvernay</strong> was at times a decent flex option as the team's #3 WR. The big question for his finale in Austin is will he approach anything close to Johnson's #2 production, or will his 5'11 size keep him as the third option while one of the Longhorns' talented young 4-stars steps into the Johnson role? Senior TE <strong>Andrew Beck</strong> was the starter all year but only topped 30 yards in one game. Don't count on his replacement to be a viable fantasy option in 2019.</p>
                        <h1>2019 Position Breakdown</h1>
                        <h2>Quarterback</h2>
                        <p>The driving force behind the offense's return to relevance was breakout sophomore star <strong>Sam Ehlinger</strong>. After splitting time with <strong>Shane Buechele</strong> as a freshman in 2017, Ehlinger earned the #1 spot last year in fall camp and now has a greater stranglehold on the job than maybe any Longhorn QB since Colt McCoy.</p>
                        <p>Ehlinger was more than good enough through the air, throwing for 3296 yards and 25 TD's to only 5 INT's, but what made him so effective &mdash; and an elite fantasy player &mdash; was his running ability. The 6'3, 235-pound QB was unbeliveably effective near the goal line and accounted for an insane 16 of 23 Longhorn rushing touchdowns and the most by any P5 quarterback. Teams couldn't stop Ehlinger from pounding it into the end zone even when they knew it was coming, but he was also a rushing threat outside of the red zone and finished with 482 yards. Oh yeah, he also caught 5 passes on 5 targets for 51 yards.</p>
                        <p>Those stats added up to Ehlinger finishing as the #6 fantasy QB with only Tua Tagovailoa ahead of him returning in 2019. The question is can the junior repeat those numbers, and how high should you draft him? One would imagine there would have to be some negative TD regression, but then again, it's difficult to stop a 235-pound QB in short yardage situations. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Despite the loss of Humphrey, Ehlinger will have a deeper overall receiving corps thanks to an influx of young talent, and there are no glaring concerns on the offensive line so there aren't any reasons to expect a setback in the passing department.</p>
                        <p>The main worry has to be Ehlinger's ability to stay healthy. He missed time in 2017 with a concussion and injured his throwing shoulder against Baylor in 2018, which caused him to miss most of that game along with some of the Iowa State game when it was reinjured a few weeks later. With Ehlinger's physical style of play, there's always the chance it could be over quickly.</p>
                        <p>But that's a chance you're just gonna have to take. There's such a high floor and a high ceiling for this kid, and he should easily go in the 1st or 2nd round. That being said, run to the waiver wire if you hear anything about an injury to Ehlinger. Buechele has proven to be a more than capable backup, but he might not even be in Austin by the time the season starts if he wants to seek playing time somewhere else.</p>
                        <p>A trio of 4* QB's are worth keeping an eye on for the future &mdash; redshirt freshmen <strong>Cameron Rising</strong> and <strong>Casey Thompson</strong> along with true freshman <strong>Roschon Johnson</strong>. Johnson was the #4 ranked dual QB of the 2019 class and might have the highest upside of the group.</p>
                        <h2>Running Back</h2>
                        <p>It's all about <strong>Keaontay Ingram</strong>. The 4* true freshman logged 38% of the RB carries in 2017 behind Cal grad-transfer Tre Watson's 50% and only finished 78 yards behind the senior while both had 3 touchdowns. Ingram averaged 5.0 YPC to Watson's 4.2 and reserve <strong>Daniel Young</strong>'s 3.6.</p>
                        <p>Tom Herman's Houston backfields suggest that last year's timeshare was a matter of circumstance rather than a preference of the head coach. Ingram should be the unchallenged feature back approaching something around 75% of the carries in his sophomore campaign. Ehlinger's battering ram abilities near the goal line take away some of the ceiling, but leading this backfield still carries a top-20 outlook with top-10 potential.</p>
                        <p>That leaves the junior Young as the backup for now, but he won't carry any fantasy relevance as long as Ingram is healthy. In dynasty leagues, the other guy to target is 4* true freshman <strong>Derrian Brown</strong>. The #13 rated RB in the 2019 class could very well usurp Young as the backup before the year is over and is the most likely successor to Ingram down the line.</p>
                        <h2>Wide Receiver</h2>
                        <p>After a few years with little to no fantasy value at the position, the resurgent Longhorn offense wound up with two top-30 receivers &mdash; Humphrey (#5) and <strong>Collin Johnson</strong> (#28) &mdash; when the year was done. Johnson was supposed to be the man after leading all other pass catchers by over 300 yards in 2017, but Humphrey was a 6'4" terror in the slot. His 1176 yards were the most by a Longhorn WR since Jordan Shipley in 2009.</p>
                        <p>With Humphrey gone, Johnson should once again be the man. The 6'6" rising senior was no slouch despite being surpassed by his interestingly-named teammate. Johnson still made 14 more catches, gained over 200 more yards, and scored 5 more touchdowns than in his team-leading sophomore campaign. The sky is the limit for his final season in Austin, and he'll rightly be one of the first WR's off the board in your draft.</p>
                        <p>Somebody not familiar with the situation might take a look and expect the 5'11" <strong>Devin Duvernay</strong> to have been playing from the slot alongside his taller counterparts, but he was and should remain the starting flanker on the outside. Although he's now easily the 2nd most established receiver on the team, can we expect a jump in production when he's playing the same position?</p>
                        <p>I think the answer is yes, but only moderately. Humphrey's slot role will be filled by a youngster with little experience so it's unlikely that player or rotation of players will even come close to matching Lil'Jordan's numbers. In theory, that leaves more targets for Duvernay, but it's far from certain he'll see enough of a bump to approach Johnson's 2018 production. The senior is a solid pick with a pretty good floor, but don't expect top-30 production out of him.</p>
                        <p>That brings us to the question of who's going to take over the coveted starting slot position. With so much young talent needing a chance to prove what they've got, a platoon seems likely here, especially early in the season. If you can find the starter, they should have some fantasy value in 2019, but the greater focus here is on dynasty stashes for 2020 and beyond.</p>
                        <p>The most valuable of those stashes is probably 4* true freshman <strong>Jake Smith</strong>. He's expected to contribute immediately and has a chance to be the starter from day 1.</p>
                        <h2>Tight End</h2>
                        <p>There's not much to talk about here at a position that has always been a receiving afterthought on Tom Herman teams. Andrew Beck, the unchallenged senior starter in 2018, finished with 281 yards &mdash; good enough for the most among all Herman tight ends at Houston or Texas. If there's any optimism for that to change, it centers on the loss of Humphrey and an unproven third receiver.</p>
                        <p>Junior <strong>Cade Brewer</strong> is your likely starter. He went for 7-90-2 in 2017 as a true freshman when Beck missed the season with an injury. Sophomore <strong>Reese Leitao</strong> could also be in the picture, and true freshman <strong>Brayden Liebrock</strong> is a high-3* prospect who is good enough to see time immediately and could be a fantasy consideration in 2020 and beyond.</p>
